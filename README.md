# Finance Parser

A simple financial data parser.

The format of the data is a `.csv` as follows:

```csv
-$1,193.68	Best Buy	03/28/23	New Laptop
$2,694.83	TU	03/31/23	Stipend
```

The delimiter is a `\t` and a new row is a newline.

The parser contains some functions you can mess around with:

- Plot monthly spending
- Plot monthly earning
- Plot both monthly spending and earning on the same graph
